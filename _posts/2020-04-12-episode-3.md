This episode includes a discussion on the two approaches to mobilization: community organizing versus broad-based mobilization. Kirti and Tendor explore the distinctions between Alinsky-style local organizing (which relies on the daily grunt work of showing up, grassroots recruitment, building community power, local relationships, etc.) and the mass mobilization approach analyzed by Francis Fox Piven. The discussion draws heavily on the book “This Is An Uprising,” written by Mark and Paul Engler, which goes into the debate between the two approaches and the merits of each. The speakers also discuss which approach might be more suitable for activists operating under harsh political climate.
